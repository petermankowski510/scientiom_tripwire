How to Run and Test It
Save the code: Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., tripwire_example.py).
Run from your terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using:

Bash

python tripwire_example.py

Observe the output:
The script will first create a file named my_secret_file.txt.

It will then print the initial MD5 hash of this file.

It will start monitoring. You'll see messages indicating it's checking.

Trigger the tripwire: While the script is running, open my_secret_file.txt in a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

Add, remove, or change some text in the file.

Save the file.

Watch the terminal: 
You'll immediately see a [TRIPWIRE ALERT] message in your terminal indicating that my_secret_file.txt has been modified, showing both the old and new hashes. 

The tripwire will then update its baseline and continue monitoring.

Stop the script: Press Ctrl+C in your terminal to stop the script. It will clean up the my_secret_file.txt.
